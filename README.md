# shell_scripting_tasks
I performed simple shell scripting tasks.
Task # 1: Write a script to find the smallest number from 3 numbers given by user.  
Task # 2: Make a simple calculator which has a nice menu e.g press 1 for addition and so on. 
It should have following the functions: Addition, subtraction, division, multiplication and modulus. 
Task # 3: Through case write a shell script that can differentiate between vowels and consonants. 
Task # 4: Write a script to find whether a particular triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene.
